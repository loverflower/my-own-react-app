Explanations:

1. I used contextProvider to have opportunity unlarge our app simply. If it is final version i can rewrite it using just props.

2. to avoid additional recounts i used hooks useMemo. In this case it's useless, but if we unlarge our app it will allow us to avoid additional recounts when we render our component.
